# MIDS_Projects
## A summary of some projects I have completed while in my Master of Information and Data Science Program at UC Berkeley.

## Folder Contents

**Applied Machine Learning** - The goal of the project was to predict basketball score differentials using previous game and team data. The team used a variety of models ranging from simple linear regression and FFNNs to a complex LSTM that showed the best results from a MSE perspective. Two modeling notebooks are included along with the final presentation.

**Data Science Programming** - This project involved coding up various plots using Python (Seaborn and Matplotlib) and using those plots to tell a story which in this case was "what makes a good baseball team". An EDA notebook is included along with the final report.

**Experiments and Causal Inference** - The goal of this class was to conduct an experiment and statistically analyze the results of it. Our group wanted to determine if priming a subject by providing them with a text about machine learning would impact their likelihood of thinking a short paragraph was human- or AI-generated. The final presentation and final report are included in the folder.

**Machine Learning Systems Engineering** - The final project was truly a culmination of the class which involved employing a machine learning model on Kubernetes and being able to hit an enpoint through FastAPI. The folder contains the code involved in getting the final project to correctly work.
